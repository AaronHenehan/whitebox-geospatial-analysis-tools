<h1>Contrast stretch</h1>

<p>This tool can be used to enhance the contrast of a raster image. The user
must specify the names of the input and output images. In addition, four
contrast types are available including: 1) <i><b>Linear Stretch Without
Saturation</b></i>, 2) <i><b>Linear Stretch With Saturation</b></i>, and 3)
<i><b>Remove the Tails</b></i>, and 4) <i><b>Histogram Equilization</b></i>.
The first option, a linear stretch without saturation, is really a means of
rescalling the values in an image. For example, this could be used to map the
values in an image that range from 0 to 100 onto a new scale ranging from 0 to
255. In fact, this operation will not change the contrast of the image when
displayed in Whitebox because Whitebox automatically performs a linear stretch
between the display minimum and maximum values contained in the image header
file every time an image possessing a <i>continuous</i> data scale is
displayed. By changing the minimum and maximum values on the <i><b>Layer
Properties</b></i> tab, it is possible to change the contrast properties of the
image to emphasize certain parts of the distribution without the need for a
contrast stretch. In general the display minimum and maximum values are set
when the image is created to the actual minimum and maximum values contained in
the image, although they can be changed at any point afterwards.</p>

<p>The <b><i>Linear Stretch With Saturation</i></b> and <b><i>Remove the
Tails</i></b> contrast stretch options are similar in operation. Both will
remove the tails of the distribution of values in an image. For example, if the
saturation percentage parameter is set to 1%, then the lower and upper 1% of
values in the image will not be represented in the output image. Values within
these tails will be assigned the new minimum and maximum values in the output
image, effectively 'saturating' the extremes of the distribution. This can be a
very effective method of improving the contrast of images that are affected by
a small percentage of uncharacteristically high or low values. The original
values of all grid cells containing values between the extremes of the tails
are retained using the <b><i>Remove the Tails</i></b> option, while these
values are rescaled onto a new scale ranging between the user-specified minimum
and maximum value when the <b><i>Linear Stretch With Saturation</i></b>
option.</p>

<p><b><i>Histogram Equalization</i></b> is a sophisticated contrast stetch
method that modifies the entire distribution of values in an image (rather than
just altering the tails) by rearranging the values into bins of nearly equal
size. The result is an image with a uniform statistical distribution.</p>

<p><b><i>NoData</i></b> values in the input image are assigned
<b><i>NoData</i></b> values in the output image. The output raster is of the
<i>float</i> data type and <i>continuous</i> data scale.</p>
