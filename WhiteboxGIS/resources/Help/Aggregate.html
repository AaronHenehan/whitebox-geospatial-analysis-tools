        <h1>Aggregate</h1>
        <div>This tool can be used to reduce the grid resolution of a raster 
            by a user specified amount. For example, using an aggregation 
        factor of 2 would result in a raster with half the number of rows 
        and columns. The grid cell values in the output image will consist of 
        the mean, sum, maximum, minimum, or range of the overlapping grid 
        cells in the input raster (four cells in the case of an aggregation 
        factor of 2).</div>
