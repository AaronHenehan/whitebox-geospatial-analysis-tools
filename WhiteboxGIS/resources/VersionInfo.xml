            <Title>Whitebox 3.1.2 Has Been Released</Title>
            <Message><![CDATA[<p>The following additions/modifications have been made:</p>
<ul><li>Added a Profile tool for creating topographic profiles from surface rasters.</li>
<li>Added a kriging interpolation tool. The kriging tool includes an interactive
 semivariogram tool.</li>
<li>Added the Bare-Earth DEM tool for LiDAR data.</li>
<li>Added the Canopy Model tool for LiDAR data.</li>
<li>Added the ElevationAboveStream tool.</li>
<li>Added the DownslopeDistanceToStream tool.</li>
<li>Added the GetLasFileStatistics tool for examining LAS (LiDAR) files.</li>
<li>Added the NearestNeighbourAnalysis tool for identifying clustered point patterns.</li>
<li>Added the EliminateCoincidentPoints tool.</li>
<li>Added the ShortAxis tool.</li>
<li>Added the RunPluginInParallel tool, which can run any one plugin in parallel using a batch 
 file of input parameters.</li>
<li>The ShapeFile class has a new getKdTree method that returns a kd-tree of feature
 nodes. Each kd-entry value property contains the zero-base feature ID of the node.</li>
<li>The ScriptDialog class now has an addDialogButton method.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with the InterpolationIDW and RasterizeTIN tools that did not allow 
 for the use of a specified base raster for determining resolution and extent.</li>
<li>Integrated a 'Field Calculator' directly into the attribute table dialog to simplify 
 the process of creating and populating new fields. At the moment the field 
 calculator only works with Groovy as a scripting engine. There appears to be 
 something wrong with the Python engine currently.</li></ul><]]>

            <Title>Check your Java version if you are running on MS Windows</Title>
            <Message><![CDATA[<p>The default Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for download 
                        on the Oracle site for computers running Microsoft Windows OS is
                        the 32-bit version even if you are running a 64-bit version of the 
                        operating system. This will severely limit the amount of memory 
                        that Whitebox can access and will affect performance and can lead 
                        to out-of-memory errors when handling large files. Given the 
                        large number of Windows users, this affects many people.</p>
                        <p>You can check what version of the JRE Whitebox is running 
                        under by selecting <b>Options and Settings</b> under the <b>View</b> 
                        menu. If you are running the 32-bit version on a 64-bit computer 
                        it would be advisable to upgrade your Java to the 64-bit version.</p><]]>
