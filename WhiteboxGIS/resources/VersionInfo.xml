            <Title>Whitebox Version 3.0.8 Has Been Released</Title>
            <Message><![CDATA[<p>Version 3.0.8 (November 27, 2013)</p> <ul>
                <li>Added the TraceDownslopeFlowpath tool.</li>
               <li>Fixed a bug with the FD8 and Dinf flow accumulation tools that allowed for 
                    stack overflow errors if the DEM was large or contained a very long flow path.</li>
               <li>Fixed a bug in the generate data functionality of the data base viewer/scripter.</li>
                <li>Added Depth-In-Sink tool.</li>
                <li>Modified the Difference From Mean Elevation tool to use an integral image. This
                    speeds up the performance with large neighbourhoods dramatically. In fact, it 
                    will take the same time to run regardless of the size of the neighbourhood.</li>
                <li>Added the Multi-scale Elevation Residual Index (MERI) tool for performing 
                    multi-scale landscape position analysis on a DEM.</li>
                <li>Modified the Hillshade tool so that it only requires two passes instead of three.</li>
                <li>Modified the Dissolve tool so that it can dissolve based on an attribute.</li>
                <li>Added CreateHexagonalVectorGrid tool.</li>
                <li>Added RescaleImageValueRange tool.</li>
                <li>Added ThickenRasterLine tool.</li>
                <li>Added FindStraightSegments tool.</li>
                <li>Other minor bug fixes, particularly related to the newly added multi-feature 
                    selection.</li>
                <li>Improved error logging for all plug-in tools.</li></ul><]]>

            <Title>Check your Java version if you are running on MS Windows</Title>
            <Message><![CDATA[<p>The default Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for download 
                        on the Oracle site for computers running Microsoft Windows OS is
                        the 32-bit version even if you are running a 64-bit version of the 
                        operating system. This will severely limit the amount of memory 
                        that Whitebox can access and will affect performance and can lead 
                        to out-of-memory errors when handling large files. Given the 
                        large number of Windows users, this affects many people.</p>
                        <p>You can check what version of the JRE Whitebox is running 
                        under by selecting <b>Options and Settings</b> under the <b>View</b> 
                        menu. If you are running the 32-bit version on a 64-bit computer 
                        it would be advisable to upgrade your Java to the 64-bit version.</p><]]>
