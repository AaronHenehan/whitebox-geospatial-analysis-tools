            <Title>Translators Needed</Title>
            <Message>"We're working on improving Whitebox's support for multiple languages. You can help by volunteering as a translator.
                 In the first phase of this work we have translated many of the user-interface labels, menus, and messages 
                into Persian, Greek, Chinese, German, Russian, Spanish, Catalan, Italian, and Polish thanks to the generous efforts of 
                numerous volunteers. In the second phase of this project, we would like to expand the number of supported languages 
                (Hindi, Arabic, Japanese, and Korean volunteers are especially needed, however any language would be appreciated) 
                and also translate the plugin tool names and descriptions. So there is still plenty of work ahead and any help that 
                you can provide would be greatly appreciated by the user community. If you are interested, please contact 
                Dr. John Lindsay (jlindsay@uoguelph.ca)."</Message>
