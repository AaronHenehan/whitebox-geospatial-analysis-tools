            <Title>Whitebox Version 3.1.0 Has Been Released</Title>
            <Message><![CDATA[<p>Version 3.1.0 (December 16, 2013)</p> 
                <p>The focus of this release has been improved data interoperability. 
                We have made getting data into and out of Whitebox much easier.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Modified the AddLayer method so that it accepts non-native format geospatial 
                layers and automatically calls the appropriate data import tool.</li>
                <li>Added an 'Export Layer' quick link to the various export data tools from 
                the Layers menu and pop-up menu.</li>
                <li>Added the Create TIN and Rasterize TIN tools.</li>
               <li>Added support for import of tiled GeoTIFF files.</li>
               <li>Added ShowGeoTiffTags tool for viewing the tags within a GeoTiff file.</li>
                <li>Added ImportSRTM tool to import shuttle radar topography mission DEMs.</li>
                <li>Moved all of the entries in the File menu that were related to maps to the 
 Cartographic menu and made the corresponding change to the order of the icons 
 in the toolbar. This should make it more obvious that when you first launch the 
 program, you typically need to add data layers rather open a map. Previously
 people were frequently confusing maps with data layers.</li>
                <liFixed a bug with Nearest Neighbour LiDAR interpolation.</li>
                <li>Modified the LiDAR IDW interpolation tool so that the maximum scan angle  
 deviation can be specified by the user.</li>
                <li>A raster's NoData value can now be updated directly from its layer properties.</li>
                <li>Added ImportGenericMultibandData tool to convert ENVI style BIL, BSQ and BIP 
 raster files. I was only able to get a .bsq file for testing so if you have  
 access to a small .bip and/or .bil file please forward them to me.</li>
                <li>Added ImportDEM tool for imported the USGS/CDED ASCII DEM files.</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug with the Depression Filling (Planchon and Darboux) tool that  
 affected DEMs with irregular shapes (i.e. areas of NoData around the edges).</li></ul><]]>

            <Title>Check your Java version if you are running on MS Windows</Title>
            <Message><![CDATA[<p>The default Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for download 
                        on the Oracle site for computers running Microsoft Windows OS is
                        the 32-bit version even if you are running a 64-bit version of the 
                        operating system. This will severely limit the amount of memory 
                        that Whitebox can access and will affect performance and can lead 
                        to out-of-memory errors when handling large files. Given the 
                        large number of Windows users, this affects many people.</p>
                        <p>You can check what version of the JRE Whitebox is running 
                        under by selecting <b>Options and Settings</b> under the <b>View</b> 
                        menu. If you are running the 32-bit version on a 64-bit computer 
                        it would be advisable to upgrade your Java to the 64-bit version.</p><]]>
