            <Title>Two new features worth checking out...</Title>
            <Message><![CDATA[<p>I would like to draw your attention to two new 
features of the latest version of Whitebox (v. 3.1.1). The <b>Request New Feature</b> 
tool, located in the tools tab and in the Help menu, can be used to send a feature 
request to the Whitebox development team. Features that have a greater number of 
requests will move higher in the development priority queue, so send us your most 
wanted new features! The second addition is the new <b>Error Reporting</b> feature, 
also found under the Help menu. When you are using Whitebox and encounter an error, 
use the new reporting tool to send the development team a description of the error 
you encountered. The tool will automatically send us a copy of your log files as well 
so that we can get a better idea of what went wrong. Both these new features will 
help us to further improve Whitebox.</p><]]>

            <Title>Check your Java version if you are running on MS Windows</Title>
            <Message><![CDATA[<p>The default Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for download 
                        on the Oracle site for computers running Microsoft Windows OS is
                        the 32-bit version even if you are running a 64-bit version of the 
                        operating system. This will severely limit the amount of memory 
                        that Whitebox can access and will affect performance and can lead 
                        to out-of-memory errors when handling large files. Given the 
                        large number of Windows users, this affects many people.</p>
                        <p>You can check what version of the JRE Whitebox is running 
                        under by selecting <b>Options and Settings</b> under the <b>View</b> 
                        menu. If you are running the 32-bit version on a 64-bit computer 
                        it would be advisable to upgrade your Java to the 64-bit version.</p><]]>
