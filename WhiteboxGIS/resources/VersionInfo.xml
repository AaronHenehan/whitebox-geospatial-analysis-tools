            <Title>Check your Java version if you are running on MS Windows</Title>
            <Message><![CDATA[<p>The default Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for download 
                        on the Oracle site for computers running Microsoft Windows OS is
                        the 32-bit version even if you are running a 64-bit version of the 
                        operating system. This will severely limit the amount of memory 
                        that Whitebox can access and will affect performance and can lead 
                        to out-of-memory errors when handling large files. Given the 
                        large number of Windows users, this affects many people.</p>
                        <p>You can check what version of the JRE Whitebox is running 
                        under by selecting <b>Options and Settings</b> under the <b>View</b> 
                        menu. If you are running the 32-bit version on a 64-bit computer 
                        it would be advisable to upgrade your Java to the 64-bit version.</p><]]>
